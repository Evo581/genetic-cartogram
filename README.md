# Interactive 3D Genetic Distance Map

This is an interactive 3D visualization of the genetic relationships between various world populations, based on Fst distance values.

The plot was generated in Python using a Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) to create the 3D layout. The interactive plot was created with the Plotly library.
