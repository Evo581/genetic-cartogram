# Interactive 3D Visualizations of Genetic Distances

This project contains interactive 3D plots showing the genetic relationships between various world populations. The visualizations are based on a genetic distance matrix and were created using Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) to generate the 3D layout.

The interactive plots were built with Python and the Plotly library.

## Analysis 1: Full Dataset (113 Populations)

This plot includes all 113 populations from the complete dataset. It provides a comprehensive overview of the global genetic structure.

*   **PCoA Quality Score (Variance Explained by 3D Map):** `78.58%`

## Analysis 2: Refined Visualization (112 Populations)

This plot excludes the "Faza_Bajun" population. As an outlier, its removal can sometimes provide a clearer visualization of the relationships between the other populations.

*   **PCoA Quality Score (Variance Explained by 3D Map):** `83.38%`
